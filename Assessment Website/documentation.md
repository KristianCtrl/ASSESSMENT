# Web Technologies Assessment

In this markdown documentation, I will be discussing my website, how it was created and the following sections:  

> Background
> Wire Frames
> Color Choices
> Accessibility
> GDPR
> Distance Selling
> Evaluation


##  Background

In this assessment, I will be creating a portfolio of sorts which elaborates on what I do on a daily basis. This will include employment, hobbies and more. 
I belive this will be a great way to show employers more information about me and to showcase my skills. 
There will also be a contact page where people will be able to email me questions and enquiries.

## Colour Choices
The colors I chose were to represent me. Purple is my favorite color so I decided to make my website as personal as possible but incorporating it. I think this really goes well with the black and lights up the website, giving it a futuristic look. 
The colors are simple and I think that is an advantage as viewers of the website will not be put off by it.  
 
## Accessibility

I have added alt text for the images, this helps viewers on the website, this can help blind people with a screen reader be able to read what the image is, practically describing it. 
This will essentially transcribe the images into an audio/word form. 
This not only helps with accessability but also brings a bigger demographic of vistors to the website.

## GDPR
To make sure the legal rights of the website visitors, there is a privacy policy page in the contact page. This page has all the information regarding the websites privacy policy. 
As the website does not store any information but the name and email, I was able to generate and create a decent private policy. 
Having this policy on the page helps me with the legal issues of storing data, especially with the new GDPR. 
The rights of the user via GDPR are the following:
1.  The right to be informed
2.  The right of access
3.  The right to rectification
4.  The right to erasure
5.  The right to restrict processing
6.  The right to data portability
7.  The right to object
8.  Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

## Distance Selling

On this website, I am not distance selling. This website is purely for dispalying my skills, hobbies and interests. 
The website is solely a portfolio for employers to read more about me and also an easy way to contact me via my contact form. 

## Evaluation

In conclusion, this website task went smooth. 
My task was fairly simple, wanting to create a portfolio/CV of types, mostly explaining a bit more about me, for example, my hobbies and what my work consists of. I wanted to act on the simplicity of it and make sure the website visitors could easily navigate due to this. 
I also wanted to have a type of contact form for employers and interested visitors to be able to email me. 
Luckily, with the Javascript I learned from the course, I was able to make a simple contact form, consisting of an email and name. If the user did not fill out the form, there would be errors messages due to it not being a filled out form. 

My main problem with this task was that I forgot to create a responsive website first, by making sure that the phone version came first, then the computer version. This was my main problem as it took me a bit of time to make it afterwards. This mistake wasn't too much of a problem but I should've done the viewpoints and responsive  before creating the rest of the website. 

To test and view my website on a quick and easy basis, I had Live Server installed. Live Server kept me updated on current updates by showing me a preview of the live website I am creating. This is really helpful to me as I was doing smaller edits throughout, I was able to check upon my progress. 
I was able to test the responsive sizes and view points by pressing F12 and picking different devices. This gave me a good idea of how much width should be changed and will work on smaller devices such as an iPhone. This gave me a good preview of how it will look to other devices. 

My design choices came from a person preference of simple websites. I think this style of website with mainly boxes and images will work well with the visitors of this website, this is due to not having to read much or having problems navigating the website. I believe the website design is very clear and the navigation is big enough to be viewed. I believe using this simple design will come to my advantage, if employers want to contact me, they will have some basic information on me and will also be able to navigate easily to the contact form.
